=What is this?=
HttpClient-Cache isn't API compatible with Android. Android uses a pre-release (beta) version of HttpClient 4.0, while HttpClient-Cache uses HttpClient 4.1. It turns out that HttpClient-Cache only uses 1 API that is not in Android - org.apache.http.util.EntityUtils.consume(org.apache.http.HttpEntity)

See http://old.nabble.com/HttpClient-Cache-release-that-works-against-HttpClient-4.0--p32775131.html

This directory contains the source to a modified version of HttpClient (where only the httpclient-cache module has been modified) that is API-compatible with Android.

=How this directory was made=
This directory contains the modified source to HTTPClient-Cache 4.2-alpha1.

The source was retrieved from http://mirror.uoregon.edu/apache//httpcomponents/httpclient/binary/httpcomponents-client-4.2-alpha1-bin.tar.gz and it was extracted to this directory.

=Changes=
==pom.xml==

change:
  <groupId>org.apache.httpcomponents</groupId>
to:
  <groupId>com.integralblue</groupId>

==src/main/java/org/apache/http/impl/client/cache/ResponseProtocolCompliance.java==
Replace:
    private void consumeBody(HttpResponse response) throws IOException {
        HttpEntity body = response.getEntity();
        if (body != null) EntityUtils.consume(body);
    }
With:
    private void consumeBody(HttpResponse response) throws IOException {
        HttpEntity body = response.getEntity();
        if (body != null) {
         if (body.isStreaming()) {
             InputStream instream = body.getContent();
             if (instream != null) {
                 instream.close();
             }
         }
        }
     }

After:
import org.apache.http.util.EntityUtils;
Add:
import java.io.InputStream;
